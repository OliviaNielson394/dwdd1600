        <h2>Welcome to my Art Portfolio: A Brief Introduction</h2>
        <p>This art portfolio was created to display some of the works that I have created. I am hoping to connect with
            potential clients and collaborators. If you are looking for specific art types, the tabs at the top of the
            screen can guide you to my digital or material designs. For a more comprehensive look at my art,
            the <strong>Collective Works</strong> page houses a wide range of styles, separated into different project
            categories.
        </p>
        <p>Some materials that I work with the most include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pencil/Graphite</li>
            <li>Charcoal</li>
            <li>Acrylic, Oil, and Watercolor paints</li>
            <li>Ink</li>
            <li>Chalk Pastels</li>
            <li>Marker</li>
            <li>Mixed media: ie Newspaper, Magazine, Foil, Glue, Cardstock, etc</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Studies</h2>
        <p> Studies found inside my <em>Collective Works</em> page, as well as their respective Digital and Material
            design pages include emphasis on:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Figure Drawing</dt>
            <dd>I have a number of figure drawings, from quick gesture sketches to long form studies. These pieces
                include works done in a studio setting with live models, in a natural setting with bystanders, and with
                online references.</dd>
            <dt>Color Studies</dt>
            <dd>Some of the works included were created as color studies. For each piece I focused on the <em>Tints,
                    Tones, and Values</em> in the image or swatch chart.</dd>
            <dt>Iterations</dt>
            <dd>I have completed several iteration projects, the most prominent in this portfolio being a collection of
                100+ eye iterations. Iterations are projects where an object or idea is rendered repeatedly with
                different conceptualizations and styles.</dd>
            <dt>Pattern</dt>
            <dd>Several of these works emphasise pattern. The composition revolves solely around displaying pattern in
                these works. Often, it is combined with principles of positive and negative space. </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>I have studied art at Brigham Young University, Salt Lake Community College, and Utah Valley University. For
            more information on the art programs from each of these institutions, refer to the links below.</p>
